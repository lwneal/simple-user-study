# Simple User Study Script

To use this script, run:

```
python server.py
```

Then open a browser and visit your IP address on port 8000 (for example,
http://localhost:8000).

Each survey response will be recorded as a `.json` file in the
`user_data` directory.

To print out all collected user data in a CSV format, run:

```
python parse_user_data.py
```
